# fizzbuzz
simple fizzbuzz project for intro to data structures
Fizz and Buzz is a game where someone counts up to a number n, and every number up to that number is evaluated to see if it has the qualities of a 'fizz' number, a 'buzz' number, or both (a 'fizzbuzz'). This program finds each numbers fizzbuzz status and returns it to the user (up to some number provided by the user)
